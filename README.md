# Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Background ## 

A [visualization dashboard website](https://cveras33.github.io/web-design-challenge/) using visualizations from a previous [Python API Assignment](https://github.com/cveras33/python-api-challenge/blob/main/README.md). Specifically, visualization of plotted [weather data](https://github.com/cveras33/python-api-challenge/blob/main/Output/weather_check.csv). Each weather data plot will have its own page, and the website will have a way to navigate between the pages. Additionally there will be a landing page where a comparison of all of the plots can be viewed, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

## General Information ## 

This website contains 7 total pages, including: 

* A [Landing Page](https://cveras33.github.io/web-visualization-dashboard/) containing: 
  * An explanation of the project 
  * Links to each visualization page. There is a side panel in which users can click on any of the visualization previews to be taken to that visualization's page. 
* Four visualization pages, each with:
  * The title of the visualization
  * The plot itself 
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance. 
* A [Comparisons Page](https://cveras33.github.io/web-design-challenge/comparisons.html) that: 
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them
  * Clickable visuals so that you can easily navigate to a visualization page to take a more in-depth look at a specific plot 
* A [Data Page](https://cveras33.github.io/web-design-challenge/data.html) that: 
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations
 
### Navigation ###  
At the top of every page, there is a navigation bar that:
* Has the name of the site on the left hand side which allows users to return to the landing page from any page
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page
* Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page
