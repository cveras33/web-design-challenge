# Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Background ## 

A visualization dashboard website using visualizations from a previous [Python API Assignment](https://github.com/cveras33/python-api-challenge/blob/main/README.md). Specifically, visualization of plotted [weather data](https://github.com/cveras33/python-api-challenge/blob/main/Output/weather_check.csv). Each weather data plot will have its own page, and the website will have a way to navigate between the pages. Additionally there will be a landing page where a comparison of all of the plots can be viewed, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
